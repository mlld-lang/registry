## Future Enhancements

If you want a dedicated bot account instead of using github-actions[bot]:

### Option 1: GitHub App (Recommended)
- Create a GitHub App specifically for mlld registry
- Install it on the registry repository
- Use app authentication instead of GITHUB_TOKEN
- Benefits: Custom avatar, name, and better rate limits

### Option 2: Dedicated Bot Account
- Create a new GitHub account (e.g., `mlld-bot`)
- Generate a personal access token
- Store as `BOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` secret
- Update workflow to use bot token

For now, we're using the built-in github-actions bot with enhanced messaging to clearly identify it as the mlld Registry Bot.
