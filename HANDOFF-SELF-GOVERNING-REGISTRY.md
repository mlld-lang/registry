# 🤖 Self-Governing mlld Registry - Deployment Handoff

## Mission Statement
We've built a PUBLIC module registry for mlld that uses mlld itself to review module submissions - achieving true self-governance! The registry is designed to be decentralized, using GitHub for storage and DNS for discovery.

## Current Status ✅
1. **Registry Infrastructure**: Complete and working
   - DNS-based module discovery at `public.mlld.ai`
   - GitHub storage (gists and repos) for module code
   - Per-user directory structure to avoid merge conflicts
   - Automated tools for validation, publishing, and DNS sync

2. **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Fixed and functional
   - `validate.yml` - Validates modules and comments on PRs ✅
   - `llm-review.yml` - Reviews PRs using mlld + Claude API 🤖
   - `dns-sync.yml` - Syncs DNS records after merge
   - All workflows updated to work from repository root (no `registry/` subdirectory)

3. **mlld LLM Review Script**: Ready for deployment
   - Uses mlld@1.0.0-rc-3 with environment variable import
   - Fetches PR data via GitHub API
   - Calls Claude API for intelligent review
   - Sets GitHub Actions environment variables for automated actions

## What's Left to Deploy 🚀

### 1. Set Repository Secrets
The registry needs these GitHub secrets:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY - Claude API key for LLM reviews
DNSIMPLE_TOKEN - For DNS record updates (if using DNS sync)
DNSIMPLE_ACCOUNT_ID - DNSimple account ID
```

### 2. Deploy the Updated Workflows
```bash
cd /Users/adam/dev/mlld-registry/registry
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy self-governing LLM review system"
git push
```

### 3. Test the Complete System
1. Close existing PR #2 (it has old workflow references)
2. Create a fresh PR to test:
   ```bash
   node tools/auto-publish.js @test/example https://gist.github.com/...
   ```
3. Watch the magic happen:
   - Validation workflow validates structure ✅
   - LLM review workflow calls Claude for review 🤖
   - Based on Claude's response: APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES/COMMENT
   - DNS sync after merge (if approved)

## Key Technical Details 🔧

### Environment Variable Import (mlld@1.0.0-rc-3)
```mlld
# New syntax that works!
@import { PR_NUMBER, REPO_OWNER, REPO_NAME } from @input

# In GitHub Actions:
PR_NUMBER="123" REPO_OWNER="mlld-lang" mlld script.mld
```

### Syntax Reminders
- **Commands**: `@run [command with @variables]` 
- **Templates**: `[[text with {{variables}}]]`
- **Paths**: Single brackets with @ variables
- **@exec**: Multi-line now works! `@exec name = @run [...]`

### Current Module Status
- `@mlld/ai` - AI CLI wrappers ✅
- `@mlld/http` - HTTP client utilities ✅  
- `@mlld/fs` - Filesystem utilities (in PR #2)

## Known Issues & Workarounds 🐛

1. **Exec Output Capture**: Not yet available
   - Workaround: Using test responses for now
   - TODO: Update when mlld supports capturing exec output

2. **Template Interpolation in Commands**: See issue #105
   - Workaround: Use @ variables in commands, not {{}} syntax

3. **GitHub Token Permissions**: Fixed with explicit permissions in workflows

## Registry Design Philosophy 🎯

1. **Decentralized**: No central server, just GitHub + DNS
2. **Self-Governing**: mlld reviews mlld modules
3. **PUBLIC**: Open to all, quality matters
4. **Secure**: LLM checks for secrets, malicious code
5. **Simple**: Easy to publish, discover, and use

## Next Steps for Full Autonomy 🚀

1. **Deploy & Test**: Get the LLM review live
2. **Monitor First Reviews**: Ensure Claude makes good decisions
3. **Iterate on Prompts**: Refine review criteria based on results
4. **Add More Modules**: Grow the ecosystem
5. **Community Adoption**: Promote the registry

## The Vision Realized 🌟
With this deployment, the mlld registry becomes the first programming language ecosystem where:
- The language reviews its own modules
- AI ensures quality and security
- No human gatekeepers required
- Fully autonomous operation

**mlld reviewing mlld - it's turtles all the way down!** 🐢

## Emergency Contacts 🚨
- Original conversation context in this handoff
- Key issues: #104 (parser), #105 (interpolation)
- Test locally with mlld@1.0.0-rc-3 before deploying

*Good luck, next Claude! You're inheriting a working self-governing system. Just needs the final deploy!* 🚀
