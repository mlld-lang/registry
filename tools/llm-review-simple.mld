ðŸ¤– **LLM Review Result: COMMENT**

**PR Analysis:**
- **PR #{{PR_NUMBER}}**: {{PR_TITLE}}
- **Author**: @{{PR_AUTHOR}}  
- **Repository**: {{REPO_OWNER}}/{{REPO_NAME}}

**Assessment**: This PR appears to modify the mlld registry. Based on the workflow trigger and visible changes, this looks like a legitimate module addition.

**Recommendation**: COMMENT - Human review recommended to verify:
- Module provides genuine value to the mlld ecosystem
- No security concerns (secrets, unsafe commands, malicious URLs)
- Proper module structure and metadata quality
- Follows registry naming and documentation standards

**Next Steps**: A human reviewer should examine the specific module content and validate its appropriateness for the public registry.
