# 🤖 Self-Governing Registry

The mlld registry has achieved **peak meta**: it uses mlld scripts to govern itself!

## How It Works

The registry employs **autonomous LLM-powered governance** for module submissions:

### 1. **LLM PR Review** (`llm-review.mld`)
When someone submits a module via auto-publish:
- 🧠 **Claude reviews the PR** using a comprehensive evaluation framework
- 🔍 **Analyzes code quality**, security, usefulness, and documentation
- ✅ **Auto-approves** genuinely valuable modules
- ❌ **Requests changes** for security issues or poor quality
- 💭 **Flags for human review** when uncertain

### 2. **Auto-Merge System** (`llm-auto-merge.mld`)
For approved PRs:
- 🚦 **Waits for all checks** (validation, tests, etc.)
- 🤖 **Confirms LLM approval** exists
- 🚀 **Auto-merges** when conditions are met
- 📝 **Registry updated** immediately on merge

### 3. **Complete Autonomy**
The end-to-end flow:
```
Author publishes → Auto-PR created → LLM reviews → Auto-approval → Auto-merge → Registry updated
```

**Zero human intervention needed** for quality modules!

## Review Criteria

The LLM evaluates modules on:

### ✅ **Auto-Approve**
- Solves real problems or provides useful functionality
- Well-structured with proper frontmatter
- Clear, descriptive naming and documentation
- No security issues (secrets, unsafe commands)
- Doesn't duplicate existing functionality unnecessarily

### ❌ **Request Changes**
- Security vulnerabilities or suspicious code
- Missing required metadata or malformed structure
- Poor naming or unclear descriptions
- Module name conflicts

### 💭 **Human Review**
- Edge cases requiring judgment
- Unclear value proposition
- Quality concerns (but not security issues)
- Complex dependency situations

## Meta Philosophy

This system embodies mlld's core principles:

1. **Self-Hosting**: The language managing its own ecosystem
2. **AI-Native**: LLMs as first-class governance participants  
3. **Transparency**: All decisions logged and reviewable
4. **Safety**: Human oversight always available
5. **Efficiency**: Instant feedback for contributors

## Safety Mechanisms

- **Human Override**: Maintainers can always intervene
- **Review Logs**: All LLM decisions are recorded
- **Fallback**: System degrades gracefully to manual review
- **Security First**: Extra scrutiny for potentially dangerous code

## Configuration

Set these GitHub secrets for full autonomy:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: For LLM reviews
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: For PR management (auto-provided)

## The Future

This is just the beginning. Future enhancements:

- **Multi-LLM consensus** for complex decisions
- **Learning from human overrides** to improve accuracy
- **Automated dependency analysis** and security scanning
- **Community feedback integration** into review criteria
- **Self-improving prompts** based on outcomes

## Philosophy

We believe that:
- **Code should review code** - LLMs understand code better than humans in many ways
- **Automation enables focus** - humans handle strategy, AI handles routine review
- **Transparency builds trust** - all decisions are auditable
- **Meta-circularity is beautiful** - tools that improve themselves

The registry doesn't just host mlld modules - **it IS a mlld module** that demonstrates the language's potential for self-governance.

Welcome to the future of autonomous software ecosystems! 🚀
